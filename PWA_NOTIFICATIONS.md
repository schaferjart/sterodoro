# PWA Push Notification Support

## Platform Support Overview

### ✅ Android Chrome/Edge
- **Push Notifications**: ✅ Full support
- **Background Sync**: ✅ Full support
- **Service Workers**: ✅ Full support
- **Sound**: ✅ Works in background
- **Vibration**: ✅ Works in background

### ✅ Desktop Chrome/Edge/Firefox
- **Push Notifications**: ✅ Full support
- **Background Sync**: ✅ Full support
- **Service Workers**: ✅ Full support
- **Sound**: ✅ Works in background
- **Vibration**: ❌ Not available

### ❌ iOS Safari (PWA)
- **Push Notifications**: ❌ Not supported
- **Background Sync**: ❌ Limited support
- **Service Workers**: ❌ Limited functionality
- **Sound**: ❌ Only when app is active
- **Vibration**: ✅ Works in background

## Implementation Details

### Service Worker Architecture

```javascript
// Platform detection
const isIOS = /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent);

// iOS: Vibration only
if (isIOS) {
  // Only vibration alerts work
  navigator.vibrate([200, 100, 200, 100, 200]);
}

// Android/Desktop: Full notifications
else {
  // Push notifications, sound, vibration
  self.registration.showNotification('Sterodoro Timer', options);
}
```

### Timer End Handling

#### iOS Flow:
1. Timer ends → Service worker receives message
2. Service worker triggers vibration only
3. No system notifications possible
4. User must check app manually

#### Android/Desktop Flow:
1. Timer ends → Service worker receives message
2. Service worker shows system notification
3. Sound plays (if supported)
4. Vibration triggers
5. User can click notification to open app

## Current Limitations

### iOS Safari PWA
- **No Web Push API**: Apple doesn't support it
- **No Background Notifications**: Cannot show notifications when app is closed
- **Limited Service Worker**: Cannot run background tasks
- **No Background Audio**: Cannot play sound when app is inactive

### Workarounds for iOS
- **Vibration Alerts**: 3 short vibrations when timer ends
- **Timer Continuity**: Timer continues running in background
- **Active App Sound**: Sound works when app is open
- **PWA Installation**: Better performance when installed

## Future Possibilities

### iOS 17+ Potential
- **Web Push API**: Rumored to be coming to iOS
- **Background App Refresh**: Limited but improving
- **Safari PWA Enhancements**: Apple is slowly improving PWA support

### Alternative Solutions
- **Native App**: Full push notification support
- **Hybrid App**: React Native with native notifications
- **Server-Side**: Push notifications via server (requires native app)

## Testing Recommendations

### iOS Testing
1. Install as PWA (Safari → Home Screen)
2. Start timer and switch to another app
3. Wait for timer to end
4. Check for vibration alerts
5. Return to app to see completion

### Android/Desktop Testing
1. Grant notification permissions
2. Start timer and minimize app
3. Wait for timer to end
4. Check for system notification
5. Click notification to open app

## Code Implementation

### Platform-Aware Service Worker
```javascript
// Only register push events on supported platforms
if (!isIOS) {
  self.addEventListener('push', handlePush);
  self.addEventListener('notificationclick', handleNotificationClick);
}
```

### Fallback Strategy
```javascript
// Always provide vibration as fallback
if ('vibrate' in navigator) {
  navigator.vibrate([200, 100, 200, 100, 200]);
}
```

## Conclusion

The app provides the best possible experience for each platform:

- **Android/Desktop**: Full push notification support
- **iOS**: Vibration alerts + timer continuity
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent timer functionality

The implementation gracefully degrades based on platform capabilities while maintaining core functionality across all devices.
